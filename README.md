## Prerequisites
1. **Python 3.x** installed on your local machine or server.
2. **requests** and **BeautifulSoup4** Python libraries (install via `pip install requests beautifulsoup4`).
3. A working **WordPress + WooCommerce** setup.
4. A **WooCommerce product importer** plugin or a built-in importer that can read CSV or a custom format.

## Installation

1. **Clone or download** this repository into your preferred directory.
2. Navigate to the folder with the Python script, for example:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/amazon-scraper/
   Usage
1. Prepare words.txt
Create a file named words.txt in the same folder as the scraper script.
Put one search term per line. For example:
Copy code
laptop
smartphone
camera
headphones
book
2. Run the Scraper
In a terminal, run:
bash
Copy code
python amazon_scraper.py
The script will read each search term from words.txt and scrape product URLs from multiple Amazon domains.
All extracted product links (that contain /dp/) will be saved in a file named urls.txt.
3. WooCommerce Import
Download or convert the scraped data (urls.txt) into a format your WooCommerce importer plugin can handle.
You might store additional details in a CSV or JSON if you extend the scraper to fetch product info (titles, prices, etc.).
Log in to your WordPress admin area and go to WooCommerce > Products > Import (or use your chosen importer plugin’s instructions).
Upload or paste your CSV (or other format) file containing product data.
Map fields as required by WooCommerce, then start the import.
Notes
Rate Limits & CAPTCHA: Amazon may block repeated scraping. Use delays (time.sleep) or proxies to reduce the risk of being blocked.
Legal Considerations: Scraping content may violate Amazon’s Terms of Service. Use this script responsibly and for demonstration purposes only.
Customization: You can extend the script to parse additional product data (titles, images, prices) and automatically generate CSV for WooCommerce.
